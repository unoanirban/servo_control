# Project: Servo Motor Control with ESP32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi

This project provides a comprehensive guide on controlling servo motors using different microcontrollers, including ESP32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. It explores various methods for interfacing with servo motors, focusing on PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals and other communication protocols supported by each platform. 

The repository includes detailed code examples, wiring diagrams, and explanations tailored for each microcontroller. Whether you're using the Wi-Fi-enabled ESP32, the versatile Arduino, or the powerful Raspberry Pi, this project will help you effectively control servos in your embedded systems. This guide is ideal for robotics, automation projects, and other applications requiring precise motor control.

Feel free to adapt it to fit the specifics of your project!
